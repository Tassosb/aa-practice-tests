This is a practice assessment for the associations part of the Week 4 test.
To get started:
1. run ```bundle install```
2. run ```./setup_dh.sh```

The test files are in the spec folder.

General Overview:
The schema is based off zooniverse.org, a website where everyday citizens can
contribute to scientific research. A citizen contributes by making
classifications.
Experiments all have a team. A team has member scientists, who each belong
to their respective organizations. Organizations also can provide grants
for experiments.
Additionally, experiments can be categorized by discipline.

This test has 29 specs. I believe thats a couple more than the actual
practice assessment. If you can do this in under 45 minutes, you should
be well prepared for the real test.
