This is the broken practice test version. I gutted a lot of methods
practice assessment style. You need to re-write them. Run the specs,
read the errors, and get them all green.

Notes:
Player keeps drawing a card until they can play. There is no points
in this version.  The game ends when only one person is left (maybe
makes game kind of long but its how I remember playing). Players can
 only play one card per round.
 Also, contrary to normal rules, the pile starts out empty.

Hint: some methods might be missing arguments.
Hint:
  Go in this order:
    1) lib/card.rb
    2) lib/deck.rb
    3) lib/pile.rb
    4) lib/player.rb

Good luck!
